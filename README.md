The Load-Sensing IoT Device for Goods Train is an innovative project designed to improve the safety, efficiency, and monitoring of freight transportation in railways. Overloading of goods trains is a major concern that can lead to accidents, excessive wear on railway infrastructure, and inefficiencies in cargo management. This project addresses these challenges using a combination of load sensors and IoT technology.

At the core of the system is an Arduino microcontroller that interfaces with a load cell and an HX711 amplifier module to accurately measure the weight of the cargo on a train. In addition to weight sensing, the system integrates a GPS module (e.g., NEO-6M) to track the real-time location of the train, enabling logistics operators to monitor both position and cargo status from a remote location.

The code for both load sensing and location tracking is written in Arduino (.ino) files, making the system highly portable and easy to customize. A circuit diagram is provided in the repository to help users set up the hardware correctly.

This IoT solution can be deployed in various railway wagons to provide instant load data, ensuring that cargo is not overloaded and is evenly distributed. The real-time tracking data can be used for scheduling, safety alerts, and performance analytics.

The project promotes smart transportation by combining hardware with simple, efficient code. It is suitable for both students and engineers working on industrial or academic IoT projects related to transportation and logistics
